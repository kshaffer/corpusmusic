*Harmony and Form in Pop/Rock Music* (the previous version of *Computational Music Analysis*) was a hybrid (in-person and online), interdisciplinary, vertically integrated (faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate students working together), project-based course. 

The course explored harmonic and formal structures in pop/rock music of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with the overarching goal of *discovering, creating, and disseminating new knowledge* about this music through a collaborative research project. The course also provided supporting instruction in identifying harmonic and formal structures by ear, representing those structures using the standard symbols and terms of music theory, encoding those structures digitally, performing computational analysis of those digitally encoded structures, and using digital tools for online collaboration.

## Results ##

At the end of the semester, students wrote up summaries of the work that we did creating software and using it to analyze music. If you're interested in exploring the tools we developed or reading the results of our work, check out the [Billboard Corpus Analysis](https://github.com/corpusmusic/billboardcorpus), the [MatLab Chord Recognition](https://github.com/corpusmusic/chordRecognition), or the [Sonic Visualizer/Chordino](https://github.com/corpusmusic/dsp_chordino) repositories on GitHub, or read the following posts:
