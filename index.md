*Harmony and Form in Pop/Rock Music* is a hybrid (in-person and online), interdisciplinary, vertically integrated (faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate students working together), project-based course. 

The course explores harmonic and formal structures in pop/rock music of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with the overarching goal of *discovering, creating, and disseminating new knowledge* about this music through a collaborative research project. The course also provides supporting instruction in identifying harmonic and formal structures by ear, representing those structures using the standard symbols and terms of music theory, encoding those structures digitally, performing computational analysis of those digitally encoded structures, and using digital tools for online collaboration.
